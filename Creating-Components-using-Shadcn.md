Here I explain kung pano gamitin si shadcn and how to install it and how to use it in our Project.
As soon as you install npx shadcn@latest sa mismong shad cn natin we will now be able to use this
in our project ang advantage nang pag gamit nang shadcn is help us to reduce the development time for build
a certain components plus we can edit the design as much as we want , thiis will also create a global components
malalamn mo na global components yong mismong components, natin if you see a components outside the app
indicate na yong file components na yan jan located yong mga reusable components natin!
this is also create some libarary for it self if you check the package jsoon we can see the lucide reacts clsx
and other library this also create a lib file basically eto yong utils.

This utils allow us to create a dynamic style for UI natin sa shadcn just incase we want to change our design.
